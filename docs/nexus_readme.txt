This mod includes translations for all in-game dialog as well as GMCM settings and descriptions, into any language supported by the base game. That being said, I only speak English, so translations provided by myself may be poor translations from DeepL or similar. If you would like to submit a translation from an actual person, please don't hesitate to do so via GitHub pull request, linking a translation file in a GitHub issue, or sending me a file directly.
