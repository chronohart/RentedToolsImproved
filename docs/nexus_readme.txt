This mod is planned to support translations for all in-game dialog as well as GMCM settings and descriptions. That being said, I only speak English fluently, so translations provided by myself will likely be poor translations from Google Translate or similar. If you would like to submit a translation, please don't hesitate to do so via GitHub pull request, linking a translation file in a GitHub issue, or sending me a file directly.

See the Stardew Valley Wiki's [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations]Modding:Translations[/url] page for more information about how these translations work.
