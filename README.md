# Rented Tools Refresh

This mod adds the option for the player to rent a tool from Clint when he is upgrading a tool for you. The rented tool will be at the level the player is upgrading *from*. The cost to rent is 0.

Based on the excellent work of SolusCleansing and their RentedToolsImproved mod.
