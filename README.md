## Installation
1. **Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).**
2. **Download Rented Tools Refresh** from [the Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/chronohart/RentedToolsRefresh/releases) or [the mod page on NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/29611/).
3. **Unzip RentedToolsRefresh.zip** into the `Stardew Valley\Mods` folder.

## Configuration
Rented Tools Refresh includes options to enable or disable the functioning of the mod and change the cost to rent.

To edit these options:
1. **Run the game** using SMAPI. This will generate the mod's **config.json** file in the `Stardew Valley\Mods\RentedToolsRefresh` folder.
2. **Exit the game** and open the **config.json** file with any text editing program.

This mod also supports [spacechase0](https://github.com/spacechase0)'s [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://spacechase0.com/mods/stardew-valley/generic-mod-config-menu/) (GMCM). Players with that mod will be able to change config.json settings from within Stardew Valley.

The available settings are:

Name | Valid settings | Description
-----|----------------|------------
modEnabled | **true**, false | Disable this to stop the mod from functioning.
toolRentalFee | numeric, **Default: 0** | Change this to change the cost to rent a tool.

## Planned Features
- Config options to control what level of tool can be rented
- Add option for daily cost for rentals
- Translations for all dialog and GMCM menu options

## Translations
This mod is planned to support translations for all in-game dialog as well as GMCM settings and descriptions. That being said, I only speak English, so translations provided by myself will likely be poor translations from Google Translate or similar. If you would like to submit a translation, please don't hesitate to do so via GitHub pull request, linking a translation file in a GitHub issue, or sending me a file directly.

See the Stardew Valley Wiki's [Modding:Translations](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations) page for more information about how these translations work.
